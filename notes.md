# MANOGNA TEJA PIDIKITI, MPIDIKI1@UMBC.EDU

# Sequence of steps included to complete this homework:

1. I installed cwm from the official website of CWM in my Apple MacBook.

2. Then, I cloned the files of my hw3 repository into my local system.

3. I tested the correct functioning of cwm by running sample hw3 cwm commands in the 'default' terminal provided by the MacBook.

4. I opened myfamily.ttl file in Visual Studio Code and included 10 family members of mine (including me) in the file.

5. My family members covered a total of 3 generations spanning my grandparents, my parents with my uncle and aunt, and including myself with my siblings.

6. Using the foaf vocabulary, I included the base relations of everyone in the family in the same file.

7. I opened myrules.n3 file and wrote rules that specified the individual relation of every family member.

8. Also, I included the 'knows' property which specifies that an individual knows his/her corrrsponding parents,grandparents,children and spouse.

9. I added two addidtional properties namely **iqValue** and **landlineNumber** in myfamily.ttl file for every family member.

10. Then, in myrules.n3 file, I added rules for those two additional properties added in .ttl file such that the member with more iq value are smarter than     others and the members with same landline number are included as family members.

11. I created a makefile which executes myfamily.ttl using myrules.n3 and hw3_rules.n3, and stored the generated output in myfamily_facts.ttl file.

12. I checked in myfamily_facts.ttl file that all the included inferences and rules for all the family members have been drawn correctly.

13. I did commit and pushed myfamily.ttl, myrules.n3, myfamily_facts.ttl, myhw3.md and Makefile files to my hw3 repository.
